# libalgo - Algorithm library

A library for using in competitive programming and so on.

Supported technologies:
* Geometry

Supported geometry-related things:
* Geometry primitives: points, lines, polygons, circles, triangles
* Distance point-point, point-line and point-segment
* Is_point_in_polygon O(n) version
* In_point_in_polygon O(log n) version with precompute in O(n)

System reqs:
* C++11-compliant compiler required (Visual Studio 2012+, gcc 4.8.1+, clang 3.3+)
